Assignment 1: Design and Test a CNN on CIFAR-10

Objective:
- Design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to achieve the highest possible accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Report the classification accuracy on the test dataset; higher accuracy will lead to a better grade.
- Failure to meet the specified requirements will result in a grade deduction.

Platform:
- Utilize Google Colaboratory for this assignment.

Reference Tutorial:
- CIFAR-10 in PyTorch

Specifications:
- Convolutional Layers: Maximum of three layers, with a free choice of filter size.
- Pooling Layers: Include as necessary.
- Activation Functions: Any type can be used at any layer.
- Fully-Connected Layer: Up to two layers are allowed.
- Additional Components: Batch normalization is permitted. Do not exceed the specified components.
- Optimizer: Choice is yours, for example, Adam.

Submission Guidelines:
- Submit a single notebook containing your entire work.
- Clearly state the performance metrics (accuracy, loss, etc.) at the conclusion.
